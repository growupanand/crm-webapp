# Welcome to CRM-Webapp

CRM-Webapp is an **open-source CRM web app** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)  and TypeScript**. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing customer relationships, tracking leads, and closing deals.

Developed this custom boilerplate for SaaS Web Application to strengthen my full-stack development skills., Below are some **key highlights of this project:**

- Build Backend from scratch with test cases to make it work independently without Frontend
- Build Frontend from scratch using webpack and react - https://github.com/growupanand/crm-webapp/pull/65
- Build custom JWT Authentication and Authorization with access token and refresh token
- Added email service for email verification, organization member invitation Etc.
- Added Git actions to check test cases coverage for every Pull request and also deploy the test coverage report on https://growupanand.github.io/crm-webapp/
- The whole monorepo is in Typescript with shared Types between Frontend and Backend
